        "Apart from the interesing topic of multimodal analysis, the key motivation is the use of social media. In general, often we observe that social media itself is portrayed as evil and posting on social media also remains suspectful considering privacy issue. With these aspects, it is also important for us to use social media and spread the word about good use and benefits of social media. One more aspect that makes it more useful is that it can be extended to any new issue that needs analysis like some disease spreading over any area like COVID-19."

        "Multimodal learning uses information from different types of data: text, images, audio, location, and video. Earlier works often focused on unimodal pipelines (e.g., only text or only images), which delay decision-making. One example of that is disaster analysis through only images. The Earlier work involved combining satellite imagery and weather data for natural disaster detection (floods, hurricanes).  This Advances such as Word2Vec, CNNs, and YOLO, as well as topic modeling techniques like LDA, have allowed systems to analyze and interpret multiple data sources in parallel. These are the work done in current time.\n",

        "Multimodal approaches are now widely used in domains such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and increasingly, in emergency response as these approaches are very effective in fighting with these issues."
